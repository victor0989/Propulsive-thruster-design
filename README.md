# Propulsive-thruster-design
Electric ion plasma with softer nuclear fusion. Possible idea or solution to the issue of propulsion in space or engines and thrusters. I thought of Magnetar hovering around dimensions or external dimensional fields of a large black hole. Another solution because the plasma or neutron pulsar would act in a unique way with the black hole, but if it were the other way around, a white hole would act by repulsion and not extreme gravitational attraction.

Mode 1 (Soft Cruise): Low-power, high-specific-impulse electric propulsion (ion/Hall/MPD/VASIMR) for extended maneuvers and fuel efficiency. It uses light propellant (H, H₂, or Xe/Ar depending on the system) with small but highly efficient thrusts (high Δv possible).

Mode 2 (Pulse Thrust): A controlled, pulsed fusion source that delivers bursts of high power when rapid acceleration is needed (escape from a gravity well, rapid insertion maneuver, transfer time reduction). This fusion would not be a "mini black hole" or anything exotic: it would be sustained or pulsed fusion (concepts like magnetic fusion, magnetized inertial confinement, pulsed fusion) coupled with a magnetic nozzle to convert energetic particles into directed thrust.

Central Power Plant: Orbital-sized fusion reactor mounted on the ship's axis. Pulsed operating mode for maneuvers and standby mode for low continuous electrical generation.
Propeller Docking: Magnetic nozzle with superconducting coils (generate a field to expand and direct plasma).
Auxiliary Subsystems: Supercapacitor banks for surges, deployable radiators, modular shielding (lightweight materials enriched with hydrogen layers to moderate neutrons).
Operating Mode: During cruise, use electric propulsion (low power). When high Δv is required, load banks and discharge into the pulsed fusion reactor -> commanded bursts of plasma through the nozzle.

Propellant: Hydrogen stored at low density or in the form of compact hydrides to reduce volume.
Compact fusion reactor (e.g., magnetic confinement or pulsed magneto-inertial): produces high-energy particles/energy.
Thrust converter — magnetic nozzle: deflects and channels hot plasma without material contact. Prevents thermal erosion.
Energy management systems: superconductors for magnetic fields, storage (ultracapacitor batteries or flywheels) to manage power peaks.
Radiation and shielding systems: fusion produces neutrons (depending on the reaction) -> shielding + sacrificial material; be careful with D-T.

Electric propulsion (ion / Hall / MPD / VASIMR) for continuous low-power operation when fusion is not active.
